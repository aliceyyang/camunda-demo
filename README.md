## Spring Boot Web application with Camunda Webapps demo
### Run the application and use Camunda Webapps
- The BPMN model [simplified_version.bpmn](https://github.com/aliceyyang/camunda-demo/blob/master/src/main/resources/simplified_version.bpmn) is automatically deployed to the Process Engine since it is located under `/src/main/resources/`
- Other BPMN model are located under `src/main/resources/processes`
- You can access Camunda Webapps in browser: `http://localhost:8080` (provide login/password from `application.properties`, default: admin / admin)
